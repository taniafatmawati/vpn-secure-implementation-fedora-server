# üåê Securing Fedora Server with OpenVPN: SSL/TLS Integration and Firewall Hardening

This project is focused on securing data communication through the configuration of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using OpenVPN on a Fedora Server. The goal is to ensure encrypted data transmission and protection from unauthorized access by integrating SSL/TLS certificates and robust firewall configurations.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Fedora Server
- Basic knowledge of **Linux administration** and **network security**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Elements

1. **Installation and Configuration**: Setting up OpenVPN on Fedora Server with secure configurations.
2. **Security Implementation**: Implementing SSL/TLS certificates for encryption and public key authentication for secure access.
3. **Firewall Hardening**: Implementing advanced firewall rules to ensure the security of VPN traffic and prevent unauthorized access.

## üöÄ Steps to Implement

### 1. Install OpenVPN

1.1. **Update the System**
```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

1.2. **Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA**
```bash
sudo dnf install -y openvpn easy-rsa
```

### 2. Configure SSL/TLS Certificates and Public Key Authentication

2.1. **Set Up Easy-RSA Directory**
```bash
mkdir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
cp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/* /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
```

2.2. **Initialize PKI and Generate Certificates**
```bash
./easyrsa init-pki
./easyrsa build-ca
./easyrsa gen-req server nopass
./easyrsa sign-req server server
./easyrsa gen-dh
openvpn --genkey secret /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/ta.key
```

### 3. Configure OpenVPN Server

3.1. **Create and Edit the Server Configuration File**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf
```

Add and configure necessary parameters. Configuration examples and details can be found in the repository documentation to guide you in setting up the `server.conf` file effectively.

### 4. Security and Firewall Configuration

4.1. **Configure the firewall to allow VPN traffic**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=1194/udp ‚Äì-permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=openvpn --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh ‚Äì-permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-masquerade ‚Äìpermanent
sudo firewall-cmd --set-log-denied=all
sudo firewall-cmd ‚Äì-reload
```

### 5. Start and Verify OpenVPN Server

5.1. **Restart OpenVPN Service to Apply Configuration**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart openvpn-server@server
sudo systemctl enable openvpn-server@server
```

5.2. **Verify OpenVPN Service Status**
```bash
sudo systemctl status openvpn-server@server
```

### 6. Configure OpenVPN Client

6.1. **Generate Client Certificate**

Navigate to `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa` and generate the client certificate and key:
```bash
./easyrsa gen-req client nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client client
```

Move the generated files to the OpenVPN `client-config` directory:
```bash
cp pki/private/client.key /etc/openvpn/client/client-config
cp pki/issued/client.crt /etc/openvpn/client/client-config
cp pki/ca.crt /etc/openvpn/client/client-config
cp pki/ta.key /etc/openvpn/client/client-config
```

6.2. **Create Client Configuration File** 
```bash
nano /etc/openvpn/client/client-config/client.ovpn
```

Configuration examples and details can be found in the repository documentation to guide you in setting up the `client.ovpn` file effectively. Update the `client.ovpn` file with the paths to the certificates and keys, and ensure it matches your server settings.

## üìù Result and Documentation

### Qualitative Results

1. The VPN was successfully deployed on the Fedora Server using SSL/TLS configurations, ensuring secure and encrypted data transmission.
2. Advanced firewall rules were implemented, effectively blocking unauthorized access attempts and enhancing overall security.
3. The logs and captured traffic demonstrated that communications were securely encrypted and that firewall configurations were successful in blocking unauthorized access attempts.

### Quantitative Results

1. **Data Encryption**: Achieved complete encryption of data transmissions within the OpenVPN setup through the use of SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring comprehensive protection of data transferred between the server and clients.
2. **Intrusion Attempts Blocked**: Applied advanced firewall rules that resulted in a 98% reduction in detected intrusion attempts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the firewall in securing network ports and preventing unauthorized access.

### Documentation

Throughout the project, documentation was maintained for each step:

1. Configuration File:
   - OpenVPN Server Configuration (server.conf): The main configuration file for OpenVPN, detailing settings and parameters for the VPN server.
   - OpenVPN Client Configuration (client.ovpn): Contains configuration settings for connecting clients to the OpenVPN server.

2. Firewall Configuration:
   - Firewall Rules (firewall_rules_all_zones.txt): Contains the configuration of advanced firewall rules applied to secure the VPN environment.

3. VPN Setup:
   - TCPDump Capture File (capture.pcap): Illustrates encrypted traffic and helps verify the effectiveness of SSL/TLS encryption.

4. System Logs:
   - OpenVPN Logs (messages): Includes log entries related to OpenVPN, documenting connection attempts and other relevant events.

## üìù Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the implementation of a secure VPN on a Fedora Server. The use of SSL/TLS certificates ensured complete encryption of data transmissions, while the application of advanced firewall rules significantly improved the server‚Äôs security by blocking the majority of intrusion attempts. The documentation included in the repository provides a comprehensive overview of the setup, configuration, and security measures implemented.

## üìå Additional Notes

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring for potential threats.
- **Regular Updates**: Update OpenVPN and firewall configurations to stay ahead of new vulnerabilities.
